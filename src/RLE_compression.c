/*
 * The data compression algorithm RLE (Run Length Encoding) is based on the fact
that a symbol within the data stream may be repeated many times in a row. This
repetitive sequence can be replaced by
(a) An integer that declares the number of the repetitions
(b) The symbol itself
Write a program that reads a string of up to 100 characters and uses the RLE algorithm to compress it. Donâ€™t compress digits and characters that appear once.
For example, the string fffmmmm1234jjjjjjjjjjx
should be compressed to 3f4m123410jx
